Text,"During the first half of the twentieth century, oil was only a small part of the energy used in Switzerland. In the early 1930s it accounted for 10% of the country's energy supply. Following the Second World War, petroleum products became very important. In 1970, on the eve of the first oil shock, they account for 80% of the energy supply. After the two oil shocks of the 1970s this share decreased to 70% in the 1980s. In 2014, final consumption of petroleum products was 9.932 million tons; it was little changed until 2010 (11 to 12 Mt / yr), then dropped sharply by 7.9% in 2011; after a rise of 4.5% in 2012-2013, it fell again by 9% in 2014. The maximum consumption was reached in 1992 with 12.295 million tonnes. Of the total products consumed, extra-light oil (heating oil) represents 28.7% (in progressive decline, with fluctuations according to the temperatures: it is it which is responsible for the falls of consumption of 2011 and 2014, due to very mild winters, consumption decreased by 59% compared to 1973); gasoline represents 27.1%, diesel fuel 27.0% (which has been rising steadily for more than 30 years, except during the 1990s: its share was 5.5% in 1975), aviation fuels 16 % (also constantly increasing for 30 years, except in the 1990s), medium and heavy oil 0.1% (used mainly for electricity generation, it is endangered after having a share of 23% in 1973), petroleum coke 0.4%, other petroleum products (liquefied gas, kerosene, White Spirit) 0.8%"
