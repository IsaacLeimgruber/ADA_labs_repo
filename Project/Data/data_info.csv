Text,"On this map, we can see the cumulative holdings and forest mortality in 2010. This cumulative amount is 9.1 million m3 / year or 8.2 m3 / ha / year. Farms represent about 79% (7.2 million m3 / year) and mortality 21% (almost 2.0 million m3 / year). In light green, this represents less than 4 m3 / ha per day. In green (normal) between 4 and 8 m3 / ha per day and finally in dark green more than 8 m3 / ha per day. The energy wood is one of the bioenergy derived from biomass. Much used directly as a fuel, it is increasingly processed industrially as a combustible industrial by-product (liquid, gaseous, or solid). The contribution of this energy to pollution is very high compared to other fuels if the releases are not carefully controlled. It can be renewable energy if the wood is produced by sustainable forest management. At the beginning of the 20th century, wood provided about 15% of the country's energy needs. During the First World War, the lack of coal led to a greater use of wood, and at the end of the war, it covered about 20% of needs. After the end of the Second World War, the share of wood in energy used in Switzerland decreased to only 1.7% of final consumption in 1970. Following the first oil crisis, share rose sharply to 3.7% in 1985","On this map you can see the data on the Swiss hydropower plants with a capacity of 300 kW or more in early 2017. In blue, we can see the development along the water. In purple, these are the pumping-turbines pure. In green, it is the storage facilities and the red pumping-mixed turbines. The hydropower is responsible for 56% of electricity production in Switzerland. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the hydraulic installations were still supplying mechanical energy directly, so the required infrastructures were not far from the watercourses, at most a few hundred meters. From the first decade of the twentieth century, dams of accumulation began to be built in the Alps, the transport of electricity to distance production sites from consumption sites. In 1925, the use of hydraulic power directly in mechanical energy represented only 80 GWh or 4% of the country's hydraulic power. During the 1950s and 1970s, Switzerland built many hydroelectric structures, such as the Grande-Dixence dam and the Ã‰mosson dam. In 2014, hydraulic power generated 141,510 TJ, representing 54.8% of indigenous production of primary energy agents and 12.8% of the country's gross energy consumption.","The country generates large quantities of waste, whether of domestic or industrial origin. Because of its high population density, Switzerland has little recourse to landfill, but rather to incineration. The heat generated by the combustion of household waste and industrial waste is used for energy purposes. In 2014, waste generated 56,880 TJ, representing 22% of indigenous energy production and 5.1% of Swiss gross energy consumption.","During the first half of the twentieth century, oil was only a small part of the energy used in Switzerland. In the early 1930s it accounted for 10% of the country's energy supply. Following the Second World War, petroleum products became very important. In 1970, on the eve of the first oil shock, they account for 80% of the energy supply. After the two oil shocks of the 1970s this share decreased to 70% in the 1980s. In 2014, final consumption of petroleum products was 9.932 million tons; it was little changed until 2010 (11 to 12 Mt / yr), then dropped sharply by 7.9% in 2011; after a rise of 4.5% in 2012-2013, it fell again by 9% in 2014. The maximum consumption was reached in 1992 with 12.295 million tonnes. Of the total products consumed, extra-light oil (heating oil) represents 28.7% (in progressive decline, with fluctuations according to the temperatures: it is it which is responsible for the falls of consumption of 2011 and 2014, due to very mild winters, consumption decreased by 59% compared to 1973); gasoline represents 27.1%, diesel fuel 27.0% (which has been rising steadily for more than 30 years, except during the 1990s: its share was 5.5% in 1975), aviation fuels 16 % (also constantly increasing for 30 years, except in the 1990s), medium and heavy oil 0.1% (used mainly for electricity generation, it is endangered after having a share of 23% in 1973), petroleum coke 0.4%, other petroleum products (liquefied gas, kerosene, White Spirit) 0.8%","During the first half of the twentieth century, coal is the main energy resource of the country. Before the First World War, coal, used for both heat production and mechanical work, accounted for up to 80% of the energy consumed in Switzerland. At that time, the railways consumed about a quarter of the coal used in the country. The First World War led to a significant rise in coal prices; this situation only returned to normal after 1920; in 1919 and 1920 the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) paid for coal six times more than before the war. This rise in prices and this shortage provoked rationing, so in December 1918 SBB had to stop Sunday traffic. After the war, coal consumption slowly increased to reach an absolute maximum of about 3.3 million tonnes in 1929. Due to significant political tensions in Europe, Switzerland is a major stockpile of coal in the years before the Second World War. In 1945, stocks covered 60% of gross coal requirements. During the period 1950-1965, gross coal consumption remained constant at about 80% of the pre-war years. It subsequently declined, while total energy consumption increased sharply during the three decades following the Second World War, thus its relative share in Swiss energy consumption decreased. In 1998, the Swiss Confederation announced the end of the compulsory storage of coal. Coal was present in the Swiss basement. A total of three million tons was extracted, 40% of which was produced during the Second World War, in response to supply problems. Coal mining in the subsoil was definitively abandoned in 1947 following the resumption of post-war imports. In 2014, there is no more coal mining in Switzerland; 192 000 tonnes were imported and 241 000 tonnes consumed. The quantity of coal consumed in 2014, corresponding to 5 910 TJ, is used at 93% in the cement industry and at 7% by households","Gas was extracted from the Swiss basement from 1985 to 1994 in Finsterwald, Canton Lucerne. This production accounted for only 0.4% of the indigenous production of primary energy agents in 1985, at the peak of production. The discovered natural gas deposits are too modest to justify economic exploitation. During the 1960s, gas was produced in Switzerland by cracking petroleum products; City gas production from coal and petroleum products, which accounted for more than a quarter of the needs in 1970, gradually disappeared and died in 2008.","On this map, we can see the four power plants in operation in Switzerland in 2017. The uranium ores in the Swiss basement have never been mined. Research was carried out between 1957 and 1977. Numerous deposits were discovered, most of them in the canton of Valais, the others in the cantons of Grisons and St. Gallen. In 1979, a subsidy of 1.5 million Swiss francs was granted by the Confederation to encourage the exploration of uranium, a subsidy distributed from 1980 to 1984. Switzerland does not have a nuclear fuel production plant. this type does not exist. Swiss nuclear power plants therefore operate with imported fuel. There is no federal policy on the supply of nuclear fuel, as the private companies that own the plants take all of their purchases. The Federal Office of Energy does not count nuclear fuel in energy imports, so figures given by the federal authorities for imports of energy agents do not take into account the energy value of nuclear fuel. The commercial use of nuclear energy began in 1969 with the commissioning of the Beznau nuclear reactor 1. Nuclear power plants are facilities that use controlled nuclear fission to produce electricity for commercial purposes. The four Swiss nuclear power plants have a capacity of 3.2 GW and their annual availability is around 90%. The Federal Office of Energy (OFEN) performs important tasks in the field of nuclear energy law enforcement. As an autonomous public law institution of the Swiss Confederation, the Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate (IFSN) is responsible for monitoring the safety of Swiss nuclear installations. In Switzerland, the license to operate a nuclear power plant is normally issued for an unlimited period. A nuclear power plant can be operated as long as its security is guaranteed. If the conditions for the safe operation of a nuclear power station are no longer fulfilled, the operating license may be withdrawn at any time. The holder of the operating license must proceed without delay with the decommissioning of his installation if the criteria of decommissioning appear in the order of the DETEC on the method and on the standards of verification of the criteria of the decommissioning. provisional service of a nuclear power plant are fulfilled.","On this map, many things are shown. It shows the various past and current deep geothermal projects located in Switzerland in early 2017 (the pentagon). Different statuses corresponding to different stages of project progress are possible. Abandoned projects are in red. Planning projects are orange in planning. Those under construction are blue and those operational are green. The circles represent the wind power plants in early 2017 too. In blue we can see the intallations independent and in purple we can see the Aeolian pacs. We can also see that there are several different colors. In light blue, it is the exploitation with a power smaller than 100 Kw. In blue (normal), it is the intallations which have a power between 100 and 1000 Kw and to finish that in dark blue are the one with a power greater than 1000Kw. We can also see (with the squares) the location of the main areas with wind potential highlighted by the Swiss Confederation in May 2017. Let's now take a closer look at what normally makes up renewable energies. Hydraulic power is a renewable energy, as well as wood and waste; however, given their importance in the Swiss energy sector, these energies are accounted for separately in the statistics. The Federal Office for the Environment considers in its statistics, as other renewable energies, solar energy, wind energy, biogas, biofuels and ambient heat. Solar energy is of two types: photovoltaic and solar thermal. In 2014, the 39,440 photovoltaic installations had an installed capacity of 1,060.6 MWp and produced 841.6 GWh, or 1.2% of the country's electricity production; solar collectors for the production of hot water or hay drying total 1.48 million m2 and a heat output of 1,057 MWth; their heat output reaches 614 GWh. in total, solar represents 2.3% of indigenous energy production. In 2014, Switzerland installed 320 MWp in photovoltaic power, increasing by 42% its cumulative power to 1,076 MWp at the end of 2014 and ranking 19th in the world. Wind energy has also been used in Switzerland for miller work. As in neighboring countries, this use was abandoned with the arrival of steam and electricity. Wind energy has been developing in countries such as Germany and Denmark for several decades, but in Switzerland the conditions are poor. In 2014, the installed capacity of the 37 Swiss wind turbines is 60.3 MW and wind-generated electricity production amounts to 100.9 GWh, or 0.15% of the national electricity production."
