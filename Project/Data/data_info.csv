Text,"The Beznau nuclear power station is located on the artificial island of Beznau on the Aare, in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland. With a capacity of twice 365 MW, it is since February 2012, the oldest operating nuclear power station in the world since the closure of the British power station Oldbury. 365 MW, commissioned in 1969, initially planned for 40 years (2009). Beznau 1 is the oldest functioning nuclear reactor in the world. In 2006, the total power is 730 MW making it the third largest nuclear power plant in Switzerland. In 2006, the Beznau 1 and 2 reactors produced 2,920 and 3,058 GWh, respectively, or 22.8% of Switzerland's nuclear power generation. The plant is used as a base, it produces a constant power and does not perform load monitoring. In addition to electricity, the plant supplies about 18,000 inhabitants in the region in heat thanks to the Refuna5 heat network.","The Beznau nuclear power station is located on the artificial island of Beznau on the Aare, in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland.

It is the first Swiss plant to have exceeded the symbolic 1,000 MW of gross power. It was commissioned service in November 1979 and produces about 8,072 GWh per year","The Leibstadt nuclear power plant is located in the canton of Aargau in Switzerland, a few steps downstream from the confluence of the Aare and the Rhine. This nuclear power plant is the newest in Switzerland, it was commissioned on December 15, 1984. In 2003, a Greenpeace activist managed to climb the containment (concrete dome) of the nuclear reactor before being spotted. This action was intended to demonstrate the fragility of the plants. In 2006, the Leibstadt plant produced 9,367 GWh, or 35.7% of Switzerland's nuclear power generation.","The Mühleberg nuclear power plant is a nuclear power plant located in Switzerland, in the north of the canton of Berne.The Mühleberg power plant comprises a single boiling water reactor (REB) with a maximum thermal power of 1097 megawatts. The generator of the Mühleberg power station, with an electric capacity of 335 MW, makes it the smallest Swiss nuclear power station in terms of power delivered on the grid. It was commissioned on November 6, 1972. It is the second nuclear power plant to be operated in the country and one of the oldest in the world. On October 30, 2013, the company BKW FMB Energie SA announced the closure of the Mühleberg nuclear power plant for 2019, due to investments that were too expensive, to say too expensive, for the continuation of nuclear exploitation. The cost of dismantling is estimated at more than 2.1 billion Swiss francs",1224,1234,1234
