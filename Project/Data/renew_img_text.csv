Text,This represents the evolution of solar energy. These are mostly photovoltaic panels placed on the roofs to capture the sun's rays and produce energy from it.,"The proposed statistical study is based on operating data provided by the plant managers and on the statistics of the Federal Office of Energy on electric heat pumps, on which the sales figures of the installers of heat pump. The statistics show that the geothermal heat production achieved in 2016 is 3'726GWh, of which the share of renewable geothermal energy (cold source) is about 2'762GWh. The heating degree days of 2016 show, compared to the last 20 years, an average year.The generation of geothermal heat has been increased by almost 9% compared to 2015, mainly because of colder temperatures. deep (0.5%, 17.9GWh), water use tunnels (0.2%, 5.5GWh) and deep geothermal probes (0.06%, 2.1GWh). Systems not based on heat pumps are mainly thermal baths (193GWh). To this must be added the production of the Riehen facility (deep aquifer), partially realized without a heat pump (5.2GWh). For the Lötschberg tunnel, a large part of the geothermal heat (2.0GWh) is used directly without a heat pump for fish farming. This curve mainly represents the geothermal probes","The proposed statistical study is based on operating data provided by the plant managers and on the statistics of the Federal Office of Energy on electric heat pumps, on which the sales figures of the installers of heat pump.

Average annual production is estimated at 128 million kilowatt-hours (kWh). This is equivalent to 36,600 Swiss households or 0.2% of Switzerland's total electricity consumption."
