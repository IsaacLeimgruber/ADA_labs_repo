Text,"This represents the evolution of solar energy. These are mostly photovoltaic panels placed on the roofs to capture the sun's rays and produce energy from it. In 2015, a solar park with a capacity of 6 MW was installed in Payerne. This installation covered the needs of almost half of the 9800 inhabitants of the Vaudois city. With a total surface area of 38,000 m2, solar panels generate six million kilowatt hours each year. En 2017, Romande Energie has commissioned its largest solar park on the roofs of the Industrial and Crafts Center (CIAM) Yvonand (VD). Photovoltaic panels produce 2'600'000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually, or the consumption of 722 households. The panels occupy 15'000 m2 and will produce what amounts to the annual consumption of 84% of the population of the municipality. They were installed and connected in only four months, a record time for this kind of installation, according to the group. This is the 56th photovoltaic installation of this group.","The proposed statistical study is based on operating data provided by the plant managers and on the statistics of the Federal Office of Energy on electric heat pumps, on which the sales figures of the installers of heat pump. The statistics show that the geothermal heat production achieved in 2016 is 3'726GWh, of which the share of renewable geothermal energy (cold source) is about 2'762GWh. The heating degree days of 2016 show, compared to the last 20 years, an average year.The generation of geothermal heat has been increased by almost 9% compared to 2015, mainly because of colder temperatures. deep (0.5%, 17.9GWh), water use tunnels (0.2%, 5.5GWh) and deep geothermal probes (0.06%, 2.1GWh). Systems not based on heat pumps are mainly thermal baths (193GWh). To this must be added the production of the Riehen facility (deep aquifer), partially realized without a heat pump (5.2GWh). For the Lötschberg tunnel, a large part of the geothermal heat (2.0GWh) is used directly without a heat pump for fish farming. This curve mainly represents the geothermal probes","The proposed statistical study is based on operating data provided by the plant managers and on the statistics of the Federal Office of Energy on electric heat pumps, on which the sales figures of the installers of heat pump.

The mechanical energy thus generated is then transformed into electrical energy by means of a generator. With a capacity of 28 kW, the first Swiss wind power station was commissioned in 1986 near the Soolhof farm (Langenbruck). In 2013, our country has 34 wind farms, which together produce about 85 gigawatt hours (GWh) of electricity. Located at Mont Crosin, on the heights of Saint-Imier in the Bernese Jura, the largest wind farm in Switzerland is home to sixteen wind turbines, with a total capacity of 23.6 MW. Other large facilities were built in the Rhône Valley (VS), Entlebuch (LU) and Gütsch above Andermatt (UR). In Switzerland, wind energy has a lot of potential. The annual production could indeed reach some 600 GWh by 2020 and exceed 4000 GWh by 2050. The appropriate sites are on the ridges of the Jura, but also in the Alps and the Prealps, as well as in the Alps. west of the Plateau. The technical data <wind farms> provide information on the current status of wind farms in Switzerland. All information is based on data provided by facility operators. The indications serve to inform the general public and do not constitute official information or statements of a binding nature."
