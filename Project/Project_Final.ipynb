For example we can that since 1945 the Swiss oil consumption has risen sharply as nuclear combustible since 1970.  Other energy like the coal and charcoal are almost gone. However for our project we are interested about the energy transition towards renewable energies. Here we can see that since approximately 2011 there is a transition. Indeed since Fukushima in 2011, we can see that Switzerland has begun its energetic transition. In addition, during a vote held in May 2017, the Swiss voted 58.2% in favor of a gradual withdrawal of nuclear power to the benefit of renewable energy, more respectful of the environment. <br>\n",

Indeed we can see that after the war of 1945, the consumption of energy drastically increased because it is necessary to rebuild and to have the same status of the United States, the world's leading country. At that time, energy is the engine of development and that's why energy consumption increased a lot. The baby boom around 1965 can also explain this crazy energy consumption. However we see more and more that the energy consumption slowed down and sometimes even decreased. It is a general awareness and respect for the environment that has helped to reduce this almost exponential growth. Switzerland is indeed in an energy transition that is just beginning."

    "With these graphs, the result is a lot more striking. Indeed, we can see that coal accounted for 80% of energy production in 1900 and today nothing at all and it's the same for the wood and charcoal. We can also see that oil accounts for 80% of energy consumption in 1970. The reason is that oil at that time was cheap energy and there was plenty of it. This is why oil will gradually dethrone coal in countries where it is rare. Switzerland was not apart and was following the technological advances and unfortunately did not pass through the oil crisis in the 1970s.  That's why it will reduce its oil consumption and find other energies. <br> \n",
    "That's at this moment that we can see an increase in gas and nuclear energy. Finally we can see that today Switzerland is in an energetic transition because the renewable energies start to be used and the consumption of nuclear and oil continues to decrease <br> \n",
    "What is also striking is that already in 1940, the hydrolic force was already used and accounted for 40% of energy consumption in Switzerland. However, if we only analyze this graph we can say that the production of hydrolic energy has decreased. But this is not the case because thanks to the graphs above, we can see that the production of hydrolic energy in TJ continues to increase. Unfortunately with such energy consumption, hydropower alone is not enough and that is why in our graphs, this consumption decreases. It is therefore important to study the graphs at the same time so as not to get false results"

    "We can see that there is a correlation which seems logical because the more the population increases, the more energy it consumes. However we can see that the curves are not the same. Indeed, the exponential growth of the energy graph from 1945 to 1975 is much more pronounced than the other one. From this we can conclude that the population plays a role but it is not the only factor, other factors mentioned above also come into play. Furthermore, we can see that the population continues to increase after the 2000s when energy consumption stabilizes (and even decreases). It is at this moment that one realizes that the population plays a role in the consumption of energy. Despite the fact that the population is growing, after the 2000s, a change in the moral level of global warming helps to stabilize energy consumption (a mentality that changed little between 1945 and 1990)."

    "Here it is very interesting because we can see the average consumption of a lambda person per year. We can see that we have the same growth as before but it tends to decrease since the 2000s. The reasons for this can be the same as before but after reflection, after the second world war, there was the birth of television for any public. This has pushed people to consume more and more energy because of, for example, appliances, phones or computers. This large-scale development is also to be taken into account because more and more people will consume energy. For example, we go from 0.025 Tera Joules in 1945 to 0.16 in 1990. People use more and more energy with an exponential increase. Fortunately today we can see that despite the fact that there are more and more people, consumption decreases and there is a real awareness and it is thanks to that also that the energetic transition can be accomplished.\n",
