Text,"The country generates large quantities of waste, whether of domestic or industrial origin. Because of its high population density, Switzerland has little recourse to landfill, but rather to incineration. The heat generated by the combustion of household waste and industrial waste is used for energy purposes. In 2014, waste generated 56,880 TJ, representing 22% of indigenous energy production and 5.1% of Swiss gross energy consumption."
