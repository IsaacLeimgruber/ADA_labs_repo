Text,"During the first half of the twentieth century, coal is the main energy resource of the country. Before the First World War, coal, used for both heat production and mechanical work, accounted for up to 80% of the energy consumed in Switzerland. At that time, the railways consumed about a quarter of the coal used in the country. The First World War led to a significant rise in coal prices; this situation only returned to normal after 1920; in 1919 and 1920 the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) paid for coal six times more than before the war. This rise in prices and this shortage provoked rationing, so in December 1918 SBB had to stop Sunday traffic. After the war, coal consumption slowly increased to reach an absolute maximum of about 3.3 million tonnes in 1929. Due to significant political tensions in Europe, Switzerland is a major stockpile of coal in the years before the Second World War. In 1945, stocks covered 60% of gross coal requirements. During the period 1950-1965, gross coal consumption remained constant at about 80% of the pre-war years. It subsequently declined, while total energy consumption increased sharply during the three decades following the Second World War, thus its relative share in Swiss energy consumption decreased. In 1998, the Swiss Confederation announced the end of the compulsory storage of coal. Coal was present in the Swiss basement. A total of three million tons was extracted, 40% of which was produced during the Second World War, in response to supply problems. Coal mining in the subsoil was definitively abandoned in 1947 following the resumption of post-war imports. In 2014, there is no more coal mining in Switzerland; 192 000 tonnes were imported and 241 000 tonnes consumed. The quantity of coal consumed in 2014, corresponding to 5 910 TJ, is used at 93% in the cement industry and at 7% by households"
