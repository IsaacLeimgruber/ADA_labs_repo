Text,"Gas was extracted from the Swiss basement from 1985 to 1994 in Finsterwald, Canton Lucerne. This production accounted for only 0.4% of the indigenous production of primary energy agents in 1985, at the peak of production. The discovered natural gas deposits are too modest to justify economic exploitation. During the 1960s, gas was produced in Switzerland by cracking petroleum products; City gas production from coal and petroleum products, which accounted for more than a quarter of the needs in 1970, gradually disappeared and died in 2008."
