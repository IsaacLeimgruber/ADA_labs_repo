# Title 
Evolution of the Swiss Energy Production from 1910 to 2014.

# Abstract
On this project we would like to see the evolution of the Swiss energy during roughly 100 years and determine the velocity of the energy transition. The goal is to understand how the energy consumption evolved during a set period and analyse whether the energetic transition is on its way or not. Another objective is to allow a lambda user to play with the data and display only the sources he is interested in. This easy informative tool shows straightforward insight into the Swiss energetic climate and its past evolutions. To achieve this project, we will use a dataset provided by Swiss Open Data called “Gross energy consumption: Share of primary energy carriers“ which contains everything that we need; Ratios and raw values of the energy consumption in Switzerland per source and for each year. 

# Research questions
- How did the energy production diversified over the years in Switzerland?
- Can we observe some changes in the sources in these 20 last years?
- How static is the energy production in Switzerland?

# Dataset
As said before we want to use the data set of [Swiss Open Data](https://opendata.swiss/fr/) called [Gross energy consumption: Share of primary energy carriers](https://opendata.swiss/en/dataset/bruttoenergieverbrauch-anteil-der-primarenergietrager).
In this set we have access to the shares of each energy source in Swiss and it’s in raw production from 1910 to 2014. For example, we know that in 1910 the wood and charcoal represented 16.27% of the total Swiss energy consumption and in 2014 in was only to 3.47%.


In addition to this data set we've also found on [opendata.swiss](https://opendata.swiss/fr/) information on: [The electrical production of Switzerland and its sources](https://opendata.swiss/fr/dataset/elektrizitatserzeugung-in-gwh), as well as [the nuclear production of the nuclear plants of the country](https://opendata.swiss/fr/dataset/kernkraftwerke-der-schweiz-elektrizitatserzeugung-und-arbeitsnutzung). Those additional information will help us see what amount of enregy and how it is produced in Switzerland which will help us build more precise analysis and visuals. 

# Objectives for milestone 2
- We will sort and clean the data to keep only the information that we need. 
- We will create a function to easily filter the data to represent only certain sources or time-span.

Having done all of the above, we will expect for the final presentation what is written below this.


# Objective for milestone 3 and presentation
- We are considering doing a "data story" to visualise our results and are looking at the different ways of doing so. 
- We will combine all the sources of information described above and display them onto maps and interactive graphs. 

See below an abstract view of what the final result could look like.

With interact such as: 
- Checkboxs to select energy source.
- Ability to commpare consumed energy and produced one (what amount of energy is imported).
- Add a line of reference/objective that Swtzerland or/and Europe has on energy. 
- Add of bullets to give detail on event that gave particular shift in the curves (opening of a power plant or historical event for example).
- Possibility to select a given year and to have visual decription (barplot or similar). 

# Questions for TAs
Please Look at the Project_Final.ipynb (the Interaction.ipynb use Jupyter Widget and for now don't work on git).

We did some analysis on the data and we want to do something more visual too, but will it be accepted for the project?
