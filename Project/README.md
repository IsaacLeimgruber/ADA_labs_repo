# Title 
Evolution of the Swiss Energy Production from 1910 to 2014

# Abstract
On this project we would like to see the evolution of the Swiss energy during roughly 100 years and determine the velocity of the energy transition. The goal is to understand how the energy consumption evolved during a set period and analyse whether the energetic transition is on its way or not. Another objective is to allow a lambda user to play with the data and display only the sources he is interested in. This easy informative tool shows straightforward insight into the Swiss energetic climate and its past evolutions. To achive this project, we will use a dataset provided by Swiss Open Data called “Gross energy consumption: Share of primary energy carriers“ which contains everything that we need; Ratios and raw values of the energy consumption in Switzerland per source and for each year. 

# Research questions
How did the energy production diversified over the years in Switzerland?
Can we observe some changes in the sources in these 20 last years?
How static is the energy production in Switzerland?

# Dataset
As said before we want to use the data set of Swiss Open Data : Gross energy consumption: Share of primary energy carriers.
In this set we have access to the shares of each energy source in Swiss and it’s in raw production from 1910 to 2014. For example, we know that in 1910 the wood and charcoal represented 16.27% of the total Swiss energy consumption and in 2014 in was only to 3.47%.

# A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
For our first Milestone 1 we will sort and clean the data to keep only the information that me need. We will create a function to easily filter the data to represent only certain sources or time-span.

# Questions for TAa
No Questions for now.
