## 00 - Optional Homework
In this Homework, the task was to use the Data provided in "interactive_data.csv" to obtain extract the same values and ratios as presented on [gunshot deaths](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/)

## 01 - Pandas and Data Wrangling
This Homework was split in 3 parts:
  1. Ebola Data
  2. RNA Sequences sorting
  3. Titanic passengers
  
  ### 1. Ebola Data
  In this Homework, the task was to extract Ebola Data from multiple .csv files for 3 different countries: Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.  After extracting and cleaning the data, we calculated the average deaths and average new cases (suspected, probabled and confirmed) for each country. We then merged the values in a singel DataFrame
  
  ### 2. RNA Sequences
  This was was simply an exercise of extracting the data from multiple files and indexing it such that there is no duplicated index.
  
  ### 3. Titanic passengers
  In this exercise, we extracted the data of the passengers of the titanic, for which we had informations such as passenger-class, age, embarcation port, etc.
  We then proceeded to manipulate the data in order to obtain different graphs of the survival rates among passengers, such as survival rate by class, by sex or by age, then crossing the sections.
  
  ## 02 - Data from the Web
  In this Homework, we had to extract data from
  [https://www.topuniversities.com](https://www.topuniversities.com/)
  [https://www.timeshighereducation.com](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/)
  [Rankings2018](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2018)
  [Rankings2018](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2018/world-ranking#!/page/0/length/25/sort_by/rank/sort_order/asc/cols/stats) by identifying the data requests and scrapping some html. We then manipulated the data to calcul different ratios which we tried to correlate with the ranking.
